     * and newlines included) is collapsed into the single space the formatters output between
     * elements, and leading/trailing whitespace is trimmed. Only the expected side is normalized,
     * so the formatter output itself is still compared character by character.
     *
     * When editing a fixture:
     * - tags the formatter writes without any whitespace in between (e.g. `<li><time ...>` or
     *   `</span>/<span ...>`) must stay on the same line, or a space is added that the output
     *   does not have;
     * - expected output with leading/trailing whitespace or two consecutive spaces cannot be
     *   expressed here and has to stay an inline string;
     * - plain text expectations (with significant newlines) do not belong in these fixtures.
