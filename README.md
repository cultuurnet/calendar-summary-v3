# calendar-summary-v3

Turns the calendar of an event or place from Uitdatabank into one human-readable line or block,
as HTML or plain text, in Dutch, French, German and English.

## Installation

```bash
composer require cultuurnet/calendar-summary-v3
```

## How it works

You parse an `Offer` instance from JSONLD and ask a formatter for a size. Two things decide what
the summary looks like: the **calendar type** of the offer, and the **size** you ask for.

### Calendar types

The `calendarType` property follows from the dates and opening hours the organizer entered, so it
is not chosen directly.

| Type | The offer has | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `single` | one date, with a start and an end hour | a concert on 28 November |
| `multiple` | several dates, each with its own hours | a course of six evenings |
| `periodic` | opening hours per day of the week, within a start and end date | an exhibition, open Tuesday to Sunday until June |
| `permanent` | opening hours per day of the week, without an end | a museum |

### Sizes

| Size | Shows | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xs` | the date, as short as possible | mobile apps, tight lists |
| `sm` | the date, a little longer | lists |
| `md` | the date and the hours | search results |
| `lg` | everything of `md`, plus the opening hours per day, the childcare, the overnight stay, and a warning when the hours differ during some periods | a detail page |
| `xl` | everything of `lg`, plus the adjusted days and the closed days themselves | a detail page of an offer that has them |

`xl` only differs from `lg` for `periodic` and `permanent`, because only those have opening hours,
adjusted days and closed days. For `single` and `multiple` an `xl` request returns the `lg` summary.

Using any other format will throw an exception.

### Fields that end up in a summary

| Field | Types that have it | Where it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `startDate`, `endDate` | all | every size |
| `subEvent` | `multiple` | `xs` and up, one line per date |
| `openingHours` | `periodic`, `permanent` | `md` and up |
| `openingHours[].childcare` | `periodic`, `permanent` | `lg` and `xl` |
| `subEvent[].childcare` | `single`, `multiple` | `lg` and `xl` |
| `subEvent[].overnight` | `single`, `multiple` | `lg` and `xl` |
| `openingHoursAdjustedDays` | `periodic`, `permanent` | `xl` lists them, `lg` only warns they exist |
| `openingHoursClosedDays` | `periodic`, `permanent` | `xl` only |
| `status` | all | every size, as `(geannuleerd)` or `(uitgesteld)` |
| `bookingAvailability` | all | every size, as `(volzet of uitverkocht)` |

Childcare and the overnight stay only show when the offer really has them: an offer without
childcare says nothing about childcare.

## Parameters

There are 3 (optional) parameters which can be used on the initialisation of the formatters.

### langCode

(string) Default value: `'nl_BE'`.
Changes the language of the output. Works in nl, fr, de and en. The format here is standard PHP
locales, for example `'fr_BE'` or `'de_BE'`.

### hidePastDates

(boolean) Default value: `false`.
Only used on offers with a calendarType `multiple`. When true, dates in the past won't be in the
formatter's output.

### timeZone

(string) Default value: `'Europe/Brussels'`.
Supported timezones can be found in this [list](http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php).

## Example

```php
<?php

// Make sure to either deserialize the Event/Place from JSON, or set the necessary properties through setCalendarType() etc.
$offer = new \CultuurNet\CalendarSummaryV3\Offer\Offer::fromJsonLd('JSONLD_STRING');

// This will format the calendar info of `$offer` in a medium HTML output
$calendarHTML = new \CultuurNet\CalendarSummaryV3\CalendarHTMLFormatter('nl_BE', true, 'Europe/Brussels');
$calendarHTML->format($offer, 'md');

// This will format the calendar info of `$offer` in a large plain text output
$calendarPlainText = new \CultuurNet\CalendarSummaryV3\CalendarPlainTextFormatter('fr_BE', true, 'Europe/Paris');
$calendarPlainText->format($offer, 'lg');
```

## Examples of the output

Every combination of type, size and format has at least one example file under
`tests/<Type>/data/<Formatter>/<what-it-shows>.html` or `.txt`. Each file is the exact output and
nothing else, and its name says what it shows, so the folders double as documentation. For example:

- [`tests/Single/data/LargeSingleHTMLFormatter/`](tests/Single/data/LargeSingleHTMLFormatter) — a
  single date at `lg`, with and without childcare and overnight stay
- [`tests/Periodic/data/ExtraLargePeriodicPlainTextFormatter/everything-at-once.txt`](tests/Periodic/data/ExtraLargePeriodicPlainTextFormatter/everything-at-once.txt)
  — the longest summary the library can produce, and its
  [English](tests/Periodic/data/ExtraLargePeriodicPlainTextFormatter/everything-at-once-in-english.txt),
  [French](tests/Periodic/data/ExtraLargePeriodicPlainTextFormatter/everything-at-once-in-french.txt)
  and [German](tests/Periodic/data/ExtraLargePeriodicPlainTextFormatter/everything-at-once-in-german.txt)
  counterparts

The rules every summary follows — braces, capitals, joining, order, the HTML classes, and where a
new field goes — are in [docs/formatting-rules.md](docs/formatting-rules.md).
